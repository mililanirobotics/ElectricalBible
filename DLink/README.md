# The D-Link
###Introduction

We control the robot through a Logitech gamepad controller. Generally, we wouldn’t want to follow the robot around with the controller because the cable’s short and plugged into the robot, so we solve this problem by connecting wirelessly. We use the D-Link as a medium to communicate with the robot in this fashion.
