## Introduction
This is your interface--neat, organized simplicity. It isn’t necessary to know how to write code in order to use the Driver Station, you simply need to know the following:

1. How to deploy code (connecting to the robot is a given)

2. What deployed code does

This is the program that allows to to test and use your code on FRC components. The Driver Station is the middle-man between you and the robot!, this is your middle man between your code and the robot!

Driver Station definitely got an update: revised appearance, more features, what’s not to love? Together we can relearn this adjusted Driver Station, it shouldn’t be all that different compared to its last iteration, depending on how you look at it.
