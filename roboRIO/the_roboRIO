The roboRIO
General roboRIO Overview

âž  What is a roboRIO?



A roboRIO is a more recent version of the cRIO (compact Reconfigurable Input/Output) that was introduced to FRC teams in the 2015 season. It is a faster, smaller, and more powerful version of the previous controller. Like the cRIO, it acts as the brain of the robot, and connects to a D-Link router using an ethernet cable. Additionally, the roboRIO combines the functions of the digital sidecar including the digital and analog modules of the previous control system. The roboRIO is more robust than the digital sidecar, and is protected from shorts between its external pins.
